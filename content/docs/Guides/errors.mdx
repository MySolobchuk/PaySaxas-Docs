Consistent error handling keeps integrations predictable and secure. PaySaxas follows the Problem Details specification (RFC 7807) for client-facing errors and never exposes sensitive internals in responses.

## Unified Error Payload (4xx)
Used for validation or authorisation issues. Server-side errors (5xx) return a generic message without details.

```json
{
  "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
  "message": "Invalid IBAN format",
  "details": "Field 'beneficiary.iban' must match SEPA pattern"
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `code` | string | Machine-readable identifier (for example, `VALIDATION_ERROR`, `UNAUTHORIZED`). |
| `message` | string | Human-readable summary of the problem. |
| `details` | string (optional) | Additional context for debugging. Never contains secrets or provider identifiers. |

## Error Categories
| Category | Range | Description | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4xx | `400–499` | Client issues such as invalid payload, missing headers, or authentication errors. | `400 VALIDATION_ERROR`, `401 UNAUTHORIZED` |
| 5xx | `500–599` | Internal or provider-side failures. Message is generic; no stack traces or vendor names. | `500 INTERNAL_ERROR` |

Status semantics follow **RFC 9110 – HTTP Semantics**.

## Standard Error Codes
| Code | HTTP | Meaning | Typical Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `VALIDATION_ERROR` | `400 / 422` | Field validation failed. | Check schema, types, and mandatory fields. |
| `INVALID_SIGNATURE` | `400` | JWS or HMAC signature verification failed. | Regenerate the signature using the correct secret. |
| `UNAUTHORIZED` | `401` | Missing or invalid OAuth token. | Request a new OAuth 2.1 token and retry. |
| `INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS` | `403` | Token scope does not allow the action. | Use the correct scope (for example, `payments:write`). |
| `RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND` | `404` | Entity not found (customer, account, payment, etc.). | Verify the resource ID or creation step. |
| `INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS` | `409` | Balance too low to complete the request. | Retry after top-up or use another account. |
| `INTERNAL_ERROR` | `500` | Unexpected server error. | Retry later or contact support with logs. |
| `PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE` | `502` | Downstream provider temporarily offline. | Retry with exponential backoff. |

`5xx` responses never reveal stack traces, SQL errors, EPC routing details, or provider names.

## EPC / SEPA-Specific Mapping
The API may surface European Payments Council return reasons inside the `details` field for context only.

| EPC Code | HTTP | API Code | Message |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `RR04` | `400` | `REGULATORY_REASON` | Blocked due to compliance or sanction screening. |
| `FF01` | `400` | `FRAUD_SUSPECTED` | Fraud or AML rule triggered. |

EPC codes such as `AC01`, `AM04`, or `RC01` appear solely as hints; they never expose internal sanction or compliance workflows.
