PaySaxas may apply rate limits to guarantee fair and stable capacity across all clients. Even when throttling is disabled, rate-limit headers are returned so you can build resilient retry logic.

## Response Headers
| Header | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | Maximum number of requests allowed in the current window. | `100` |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Requests left before the limit is reached. | `20` |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | Timestamp (ISO 8601, UTC) when the window resets. | `2025-10-24T13:00:00Z` |

## Throttle Behaviour
- When the limit is exceeded, the API returns **HTTP 429 Too Many Requests**.
- A `Retry-After` header indicates how many seconds to wait before retrying.
- Clients should implement exponential back-off or jitter to avoid synchronized retries.
- Header semantics align with **RFC 6585** (HTTP status codes) and **RFC 9293** (HTTP RateLimit fields). Handling `Retry-After` follows **RFC 9110 §10.2.3**.

### Example (limit reached)
```json
{
  "error": "rate_limit_exceeded",
  "error_description": "Too many requests. Please retry after 60 seconds."
}
```

## Current Status
Active throttling is not yet enforced. Headers may still be present so that clients can prepare logic ahead of the rollout.

Monitor release notes for any changes to rate-limit windows or enforcement dates.
