PaySaxas versions the API to preserve backwards compatibility while letting teams adopt new features at their own pace.

## Versioning Strategy
- Endpoints are prefixed with a semantic version (for example, `/v1/`, `/v2/`).
- Each major version represents a lifecycle stage, from launch to deprecation.
- Breaking changes ship only with a new major version; minor releases are backwards compatible.

## Specifying the Version
You can target a specific version through the URL or through headers.

| Method | How to use | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| URL-based | `https://api.paysaxas.com/v1/...` | Useful for prototypes or single-version integrations. |
| Header-based | `Accept: application/vnd.paysaxas.v1+json` | Recommended. Enables switching versions without touching endpoint paths. |

Header negotiation is preferred for production workloads because it enables smoother migrations and gradual rollouts.

## Deprecation Policy
- Planned deprecations are announced in advance via developer updates, release notes, and response headers.
- Deprecated versions remain accessible for a defined transition period.
- Clients are expected to schedule migrations and validate behaviour in the new version before the retirement date.

## Communication Channels
Version launches, sunset timelines, and migration guides are shared through:
- API changelogs and documentation updates.
- Email notifications to registered contacts.
- Platform status announcements and in-app messaging.

Stay subscribed to these channels to avoid surprises and keep your integration current.
