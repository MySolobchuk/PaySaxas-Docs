Management of customer accounts.

Each Account represents an internal ledger object linked to a verified Customer (either Individual or Business).
Accounts are used to hold balances, process payments, and manage compliance-related activity within the PaySaxas ecosystem.

#### Definition

> An Account is a unique financial record within the ledger associated with one verified customer.
> Each account is created in a single currency and has its own lifecycle and identifiers (account ID, vIBAN, status).
> Account types define operational purpose:

- Personal Account — created for individual (KYC) clients.
- Business Account — created for corporate (KYB) clients.

Relationship:

> One Customer many Accounts (1:N relationship).
> An account cannot exist without a verified customer.
> Account identifiers are immutable once created.
