Notifies your endpoint about transaction lifecycle updates in real time.   Each webhook payload contains **only** the transaction `id`.   To retrieve full details, call `GET /transactions/{id}`.   Respond with **2xx** within **5 seconds** to acknowledge receipt.   On non-2xx, deliveries are retried up to **3 times** within 24 hours using exponential backoff.   Deduplicate using both `X-Request-Id` and the received `id`.   HTTPS (TLS 1.2 or higher) is required for delivery.
