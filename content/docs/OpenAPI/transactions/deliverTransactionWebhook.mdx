Webhooks deliver real-time notifications about transaction lifecycle changes.   Each webhook contains only the transaction `id` in its body,   and the event type is provided via the `X-Event` header.   After receiving a webhook, clients must fetch the full transaction details via `GET /transactions/{id}`.
