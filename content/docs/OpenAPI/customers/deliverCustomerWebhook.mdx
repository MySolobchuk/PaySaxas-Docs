Webhooks notify your system about customer lifecycle events such as creation, status changes, or suspension.   Each webhook delivers a **minimal payload containing only the customer ID**.   The event type is passed exclusively via the `X-Event` header for security and consistency.   For full customer details, always call **GET /customers/\{id\}** after receiving the webhook.
