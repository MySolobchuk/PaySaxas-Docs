Notifies your endpoint about asynchronous lifecycle changes of outgoing payments.   Payload contains **only** the entity `id` (no names, IBANs, amounts, or other PII).   Respond with **2xx** within **5 seconds**. On non-2xx, deliveries are retried with exponential backoff. Deduplicate using `X-Request-Id` together with the received `id`. After receiving a webhook, fetch details via API (`GET /payments/{id}`).
